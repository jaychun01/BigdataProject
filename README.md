# Big data Project
## Purpose
I have been interested in Big data for several years. I attended lectures related in Big data, and I had a great oppotunity to participate big data project with professor and graduate students. National Information Society Agency(NIA) and Gyeongsangbuk-do Big Data Center promoted the project to support midium-sized company using big data to gain competitive advantage. Our laboratory has been dedicated for cosmetic company which is trying to launch new brand. Since the company didn't have internal data, We used social data to propose solutions. My duty was to scrap unstructured data from websites and social network services such as naver blog, naver cafe, facebook and instagram. I did correlation analysis and visualization with crawling data as well. While the project is in the process, our suggestions increase sales five times larger and twelve times at last. As a result, our solution was elected to one of the best practices.
